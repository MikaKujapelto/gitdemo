# Git Workshop - Heading I

Going through the basics of git and how to use it.

## Getting Started - Heading II

We will only play with the README.md file which is written in Markdown. Basics of the markdown, check [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/markdown-syntax-guide-776639995.html)

Of course there are other resources too.

By the way, markdown is used by some CMS as well like Grav and Ghost...

### Prerequisities - Heading III

With Mac everything is a bit easier. Windows users have to first install git [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [https://git-for-windows.github.io/](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
